# Guide
A helpful guide on how to run this application

## Installation

Download the Repo somewhere on your system with a bit of space.<br/>
Specify *myLocalDirectory* in *bomb_builder.py:*
```python
myLocalDirectory = r'C:\Users\noelb\Desktop\Private Projects\dabomb\Bomb'
```

Make sure you include **Bomb** in your path

## Run Code

Make sure you're in the */Bomb* directory, then type:
```console
python.exe .\main.py
```

## Demonstration
A short demo on how the program should run:
```console
-----------------------------------------------
(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)

- !WELCOME!
To No√´ls magical Zip Bomb Simulation. 
My name is Al and I'll help you on your mildly suicidal mission of building a bomb on your local machine!
-----------------------------------------------
Hit Enter when you're ready...
```
_**Enter**_
```console
·ïï(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)·ïó

- Before We make our bomb, I need to know what size it's gonna take. 
A bigger bomb needs more time to generate and won't open fast but it'll take up a lot of space faster, 
while a smaller bomb is generated fast and with enough triggers, it can become really harmful. So, 
How big should our bomb be? On a scale from 1 to 10? (I recommend using 4)
```
